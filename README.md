# Drone_Dispatch

#### Database Description

design and develop a system to monitor deliveries of grocery products to customers. This system will support a "third party" grocery service. Customers will place orders with the service. The service will coordinate with grocery stores to find the products (at variable – but hopefully the lowest – prices) and arrange for a drone to deliver the products to the customer. On delivery, the store will be paid electronically by the customer.
